# Getting Started

```
nvm install node                # download and install latest stable Node
nvm alias default node          # make it default version
nvm list                        # check

brew install yarn               # you can use other installer if desired

brew install imagemagick        # required for image uploader

rvm install 2.3.1               # download and install latest stable Ruby (update to exact version)
rvm use 2.3.1 --default         # use it and make it default
rvm list                        # check

gem install rails               # download and install latest stable Rails
gem install foreman             # download and install Foreman
bundle && yarn
```

### To Run the Server

`foreman start -f Procfile.dev`

This is based off a [react_on_rails gem tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md). Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

To get the app running: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
then visit: `http://localhost:3000/`

### Postgres Table Initializer

To start postgres:
`brew services start postgresql`

Then to start psql:
`psql -d postgres`

To make a new role and password:

```
postgres=# CREATE ROLE friend WITH LOGIN password 'lighthouse';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE find_me_friends OWNER friend;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE friend SUPERUSER;
ALTER ROLE
```

`\q to quit psql`

Then run the migrations:
`bin/rails db:migrate`

If at any time you want to stop postgres:
`brew services stop postgresql`

Once you have the database, you can get to the table using:
`psql find_me_friends`

If you need to change something with the migrations/seeds and you need to drop the table, follow these steps:
1. Make the migrations: `bin/rails g migration <migration name>`
2. Drop the table: `bin/rails db:drop`
3. Create the database again: `psql -d postgres` then `create database find_me_friends owner friend;` (same as above)
4. Migrate the tables: `bin/rails db:migrate`
4. Seed the database: `bin/rails db:seed`
